# IncrementalK-meansClustering

This project is part of my undergrad curriculum.
It deals with devising a Incremental k-means clustering algorithm using Graphics Processing Units to handle huge datasets to overcome the limitations of the existing k-means algorithm. The Incremental k-means clustering algorithm finds the number of clusters in input data by updating centroids incrementally. Euclidean distance formula finds the distncae between input data items. 

To obtain optimization of the results, NVIDIA's GEFORCE GTX 860M Graphics Processing unit was used. 

Time analysis was done to compare the results of k-means and Incremental k-means algorithms.
